## EDUCATION

<hr>

California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Graduating Spring of 2026)  
Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (3.69 GPA)

## WORK EXPERIENCE

<hr>

<p class="big">
    Wake Forest University Biomedical Research Internship<br>(May 2025 – July 2025)
</p>

- Implemented a Linux ROS control system for the Da Vinci surgical robot, that used an electromagnetic tracker to correct end-effector position errors.
- Created a Unity VR application for real-time generation of tool paths for in-situ laparoscopic bio-printing.
- Conducted research on a novel algorithm for generating non-planar tool paths with consistent separation.
- Created algorithms to use regularized least-squares optimization to fit NURBS surfaces to arbitrary 3D loops.

<p class="big">
    Ti Point Inc. Internship<br>(June 2024 – July 2024)
</p>

- Developed hardware and software for a remote sensor network to measure vibration modes of rigid structures.
- Designed circuit boards around the RP2040 MCU, inertial measurement units, and RS485 communications.
- Developed clock synchronization algorithms and communication protocols in embedded C.
- Derived data processing algorithms in MATLAB that used recursive filters and real-time vector correction.

## PROJECTS

<hr>

<p class="big">
    Space Mouse
</p>

- Created an open-source project to explore a new kind of user input device for 3D CAD systems.
- Designed circuit boards, wrote embedded C code, developed signal processing algorithms, 3D printed complex enclosures, and integrated my system with Linux/Windows OS through TinyUSB API.

<p class="big">
    Custom Guitar
</p>

- Received mentorship and advice from a professional engineer to design and build two custom guitars from scratch using CAD/CAM/CNC.

## EXTRACURRICULARS

<hr>

<p class="big">
    CPP Steel Bridge Club - Design Captain<br>(August 2023 – May 2025)
</p>

- Used FEA software to model the stiffness of different trussing geometries for the purpose of competing at the Student Steel Bridge Competition 2025.
- Led a team of two junior design captains and mentored them through multiple design cycles.
- Designed fast-assemble connections and calculated failure modes for bolted joints.
- Assisted in fabrication quality control and the innovation of custom tooling.

## SKILLS

<hr>

C, C++, C#, Python, HTML, YAML, JSON, CSS, JavaScript, MATLAB, Verilog, ROS, 3D CAD, 3D CAM, WinForms, AutoCAD, LTSpice, SAP2000.
